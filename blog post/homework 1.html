    <p> My Sundays consist of yelling at my television when the 
    game doesnt go in my teams favor. Every year , my fiends and I hold an 
    annual fantasy football draft that tend to get pretty intense.

    favorite players in hopes of scoring the highest amount of calculated points each week ending on our players performance.
